        <h2 class="section-title">Opening a Bank Account Without a BSN</h2>

        <p>Many banks require a BSN (citizen service number) to open a full Dutch current account. However, there are several practical options if you don't yet have a BSN:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Use international or digital banks first:</strong> Providers such as Wise, Revolut, and N26 let you open EUR accounts with passport and proof of address. These are fast, easy, and suitable for salary or transfers in many cases.</li>
            <li><strong>Non-resident/expat accounts:</strong> Some major Dutch banks (e.g., ABN AMRO, ING) offer international or non-resident accounts that can be opened with a passport and employment letter. Availability and features vary by branch and nationality—contact the bank in advance.</li>
            <li><strong>Open an account with appointment + proof of registration:</strong> Several local branches will accept an appointment confirmation from the municipality or a registration-in-process letter (aanmeldformulier or proof of scheduled BSN appointment) to open a basic account temporarily until your BSN is issued.</li>
            <li><strong>Employer-assisted accounts:</strong> Many employers can help set up payroll through their bank or recommend a bank that accepts new hires without a BSN. Ask HR for guidance.</li>
            <li><strong>Use a Dutch partner or family member:</strong> As a short-term solution, some choose to use a trusted local's account for initial payments — only when legally appropriate and with transparency to employer/payees.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Documents commonly requested</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Valid passport or national ID</li>
            <li>Proof of address (rental contract or utility bill) — sometimes an employer letter is accepted</li>
            <li>Employment contract or employer letter (for salary accounts)</li>
            <li>Proof of identity photos and completed bank forms</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-title">Switching to a full Dutch account after BSN</h2>
        <p>Once you have your BSN and municipal registration, you can upgrade or open a full Dutch current account (betaalrekening) with local debit (Maestro/V Pay) and direct debit (incasso) features. Steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Book an appointment or apply online with the bank (have BSN and passport ready).</li>
            <li>Provide proof of address and employment contract if requested.</li>
            <li>Register for online banking and request a debit card; set up direct debit for utilities and salary.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 class="section-title">Tax Filing Tips for Expats</h2>
        <p>Tax residency and filing obligations depend on your situation. Key practical points:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Register with Belastingdienst:</strong> After BSN registration, notify the Dutch tax office if you will be working in the Netherlands; your employer often does this on your behalf.</li>
            <li><strong>DigiD and Mijn Belastingdienst:</strong> Apply for a DigiD (digital identity) to access online tax services. Many filings and correspondence happen via DigiD.</li>
            <li><strong>30% ruling:</strong> If eligible, the 30% ruling provides a tax-free allowance for certain incoming employees. Apply via your employer and the Belastingdienst; it affects payroll withholding.</li>
            <li><strong>Filing deadlines:</strong> The annual income tax return (Box 1) is usually due by 1 May for the previous tax year. Extensions are common — check Belastingdienst or request an extension via Mijn Belastingdienst.</li>
            <li><strong>Keep salary and allowance records:</strong> Keep payslips, year-end statements (jaaropgaaf), and any 30% ruling decision letters; these are needed for accurate filing or claims.</li>
            <li><strong>Foreign income & double taxation:</strong> Declare worldwide income where required; the Netherlands has tax treaties to avoid double taxation — consult Belastingdienst or a tax advisor for complex cases.</li>
            <li><strong>Use a tax advisor if unsure:</strong> For first-year arrivals, claim adjustments, or if you have multiple income sources, a specialist can save time and avoid mistakes.</li>
        </ul>
