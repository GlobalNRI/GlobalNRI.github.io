        <h1>House Buying in the Netherlands (2026)</h1>

        <p>
            Buying a house in the Netherlands involves <strong>three main steps</strong>: finding a suitable house,
            arranging finance, and optionally making repairs or changes. Below is a structured guide to help NRIs and
            expats navigate this process.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Finding a Suitable House</h2>
        <ul class="custom-bullets">
            <li>Consult a <strong>loan adviser (hypotheek)</strong> to determine your maximum eligible loan amount.</li>
            <li>Search houses on <a href="https://www.funda.nl" target="_blank">funda.nl</a> to shortlist properties.
            </li>
            <li>Contact the <strong>selling agent (makelaar)</strong> via the website for a viewing appointment.</li>
            <li>If the house does not meet your needs, you can simply decline after the viewing.</li>
            <li>If interested, consider a second or third viewing to confirm your decision.</li>
            <li>Optionally hire a <strong>technical inspector</strong> to check for structural or maintenance issues.
            </li>
            <li>Negotiate the price — you may hire a <strong>buying agent</strong> for expert advice or negotiate
                yourself.</li>
            <li>Give oral consent to buy. The agent will prepare a contract for signature, giving you 3 days to
                reconsider without penalty.</li>
            <li>The contract also allows time to arrange financing; if the bank denies the loan, the contract is
                cancelled without penalty.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Finance Arrangement</h2>
        <ul class="custom-bullets">
            <li>Contact a <strong>bank or hypotheek adviser</strong>. Provide financial details, employment info, and
                documents including the <em>werkgeververklaring</em>.</li>
            <li>The adviser will determine the interest rate based on residence status, house value, contract length,
                citizenship/PR status, and down payment.</li>
            <li>Loan duration is usually 30 years; interest can be fixed, floating, or a combination.</li>
            <li>Bank approval may take 3–6 weeks.</li>
            <li>During loan processing, arrange transfers for gas, water, electricity, internet, and house insurance.
            </li>
            <li>Once approved, funds are transferred to the seller at the <strong>notary</strong>, who ensures legal
                compliance.</li>
            <li>Before signing, revisit the house to confirm condition. Any deviations can be addressed before
                finalizing.</li>
            <li>If not proficient in Dutch, a translator is mandatory for notary proceedings.</li>
            <li>After signing and funds transfer, you receive the keys — make sure house insurance is arranged
                beforehand.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. House Repairs & Changes</h2>
        <ul class="custom-bullets">
            <li>Check thoroughly during second/third viewings for additional investments needed: leaks, appliances,
                paint, walls, etc.</li>
            <li>Expect the house to differ from the viewing — curtains, flooring, furniture, and wall conditions may not
                match previous visits.</li>
            <li>Repairs may involve multiple parties: movers, flooring experts, heating specialists, painters, etc.</li>
            <li>Insurance covers damages caused by repairs or accidents, but minor maintenance costs are yours.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Caution Before Buying</h2>
        <ul class="custom-bullets">
            <li>Reselling may take time — some houses sell quickly, others take years. Consider staying for 4+ years
                before buying.</li>
            <li>Plan for ongoing maintenance costs and potential additional investments.</li>
            <li>Always confirm house condition, especially for older properties.</li>
        </ul>

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Buying a house in the Netherlands requires preparation, patience, and attention to detail. Use
                professional advice where needed, verify all legal and financial steps, and plan for maintenance and
                insurance to ensure a smooth experience.</p>
