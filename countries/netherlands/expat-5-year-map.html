        <h1>The 5-Year Expat Master Map (2025–2030)</h1>
        <p>A practical, year-by-year roadmap for non-residents settling in the Netherlands — from initial administration
            to permanent residency or citizenship.</p>

        <h2>Year 1: The Foundation (Settling & Admin)</h2>
        <p>Your first year is about establishing the administrative and financial infrastructure you need to legally
            live and work in the Netherlands.</p>

        <h3>The BSN & DigiD</h3>
        <ul class="custom-bullets">
            <li><strong>Priority One:</strong> Apply for your BSN (Burgerservicenummer — citizen service number) at your
                municipal administration office (gemeente).</li>
            <li><strong>DigiD Next:</strong> Without DigiD, you cannot access:
                <ul class="custom-bullets">
                    <li>Tax portals (Belastingdienst)</li>
                    <li>Health records (GP/hospitals)</li>
                    <li>MijnOverheid (government inbox) — where official notices are sent</li>
                    <li>Banking and insurance applications</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> BSN within 1–2 weeks; DigiD via mail 1–2 weeks after BSN is issued.</li>
            <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Keep DigiD credentials safe — you will use it for many government services for the
                next 5 years.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Dutch Bank Account</h3>
        <ul class="custom-bullets">
            <li><strong>Why it matters:</strong> International banks (Wise, Revolut, etc.) are convenient but not
                sufficient for Dutch life.</li>
            <li><strong>What you need:</strong> A local IBAN (starting with NL) for:
                <ul class="custom-bullets">
                    <li>Tikkie (the national app for splitting bills — many Dutch people won't use anything else)</li>
                    <li>Automatic insurance payments</li>
                    <li>Employer salary deposits</li>
                    <li>Mortgage applications</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Best banks for expats:</strong> ING, ABN AMRO, Rabobank (all major); smaller options include
                bunq and N26.</li>
            <li><strong>Documents needed:</strong> Passport, BSN, proof of residence (rental contract).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The GP (Huisarts)</h3>
        <ul class="custom-bullets">
            <li><strong>Do not wait until you are sick.</strong> Register immediately with a local GP.</li>
            <li><strong>The Dutch healthcare system:</strong> Your GP is the gatekeeper. You cannot see a specialist
                (dermatologist, cardiologist, etc.) without a GP referral.</li>
            <li><strong>How to find one:</strong> Search "huisarts [your city]" or use websites like
                Zorgkaartnederland.nl.</li>
            <li><strong>Registration:</strong> Bring your passport, BSN, and proof of residence. Most GPs register
                non-residents without issue.</li>
            <li><strong>Health insurance:</strong> By law, you must have health insurance within 4 weeks of arriving.
                Failure to register can result in fines.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The 30% Ruling Check</h3>
        <ul class="custom-bullets">
            <li><strong>What it is:</strong> A tax break for skilled migrants — reduces taxable income by 30% (or
                provides a flat 30% allowance) for eligible workers.</li>
            <li><strong>2025 Change:</strong> As of January 2024, the benefit is now a "step-down":
                <ul class="custom-bullets">
                    <li>Months 1–20: 30% benefit</li>
                    <li>Months 21–40: 20% benefit</li>
                    <li>Months 41–60: 10% benefit</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Action:</strong> Confirm with your HR department that they have applied for the 30% ruling on
                your behalf. Do not assume — verify in writing.</li>
            <li><strong>Eligibility:</strong> Generally requires a Master's degree or equivalent work experience, and a
                gross salary above €4,000/month.</li>
            <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Typically 5 years from start date (see Year 4 for phase-out planning).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Year 2: The "Living" Phase (Lifestyle & Logistics)</h2>
        <p>Now that admin is in place, focus shifts to mastering daily life and integrating into Dutch systems.</p>

        <h3>Transportation (The OV Chipkaart Upgrade)</h3>
        <ul class="custom-bullets">
            <li><strong>Year 1:</strong> You likely used OV-chipkaart with pay-as-you-go or day passes.</li>
            <li><strong>Year 2 upgrade:</strong> Switch to a Personal OV-chipkaart (registered to you) with an
                <strong>NS Flex subscription</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>NS Flex benefit:</strong> 40% off trains during off-peak hours (after 9 AM on weekdays, all day
                weekends).</li>
            <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Around €93–€151/month depending on zones; savings increase with commute distance.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Biking:</strong> By Year 2, invest in a quality Dutch bike (€100–€200 used). Cycling is faster
                for short distances and saves transport costs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Weather Strategy</h3>
        <ul class="custom-bullets">
            <li><strong>Download Buienradar.</strong> It is the most accurate rain-prediction app in the Netherlands.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Trust it:</strong> If Buienradar says it will rain in 10 minutes, it will. Plan outdoor
                activities accordingly.</li>
            <li><strong>Why matter:</strong> Dutch weather changes rapidly; Buienradar saves you from unexpected
                downpours.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Waste Management (Afvalkalender)</h3>
        <ul class="custom-bullets">
            <li><strong>Every municipality has a different schedule.</strong> You will get fined for:
                <ul class="custom-bullets">
                    <li>Putting trash out on the wrong day (€50–€150 fine)</li>
                    <li>Using the wrong container (compost in recycling, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Overfilled bins</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Action:</strong> Visit your gemeente website and download your Afvalkalender, or get a paper
                copy at your local town hall.</li>
            <li><strong>Typical categories:</strong> General waste, paper/cardboard, plastic, glass, compost.</li>
            <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Neighbourhoods sometimes have shared waste stations — ask your landlord or
                neighbours.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Insurances (Beyond Health)</h3>
        <p>Health insurance is mandatory, but other insurances are essential to protect yourself in Dutch life.</p>

        <h4>WA-Verzekering (Liability Insurance)</h4>
        <ul class="custom-bullets">
            <li><strong>Cost:</strong> €2–€5/month.</li>
            <li><strong>Covers:</strong> If you accidentally damage someone else's property (e.g., hit a car with your
                bike, break a neighbor's window).</li>
            <li><strong>Why essential:</strong> Dutch people are quick to claim damages. Liability insurance protects
                you.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Inboedel (Home Contents Insurance)</h4>
        <ul class="custom-bullets">
            <li><strong>Covers:</strong> Your belongings inside your house (furniture, electronics, clothes) in case of
                theft, fire, or water damage.</li>
            <li><strong>Cost:</strong> €5–€15/month depending on coverage and deductible.</li>
            <li><strong>Renters:</strong> Especially important because landlord's insurance does not cover your
                belongings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Year 3: The Investment Phase (Home & Career)</h2>
        <p>By Year 3, you have demonstrated financial stability. Major life decisions — buying a home, career
            advancement, family planning — become realistic.</p>

        <h3>Buying a House</h3>
        <ul class="custom-bullets">
            <li><strong>Mortgage eligibility:</strong> After 2–3 years, you usually have enough tax history for a
                mortgage application.</li>
            <li><strong>100% Mortgages:</strong> Unlike many countries, the Netherlands often allows you to borrow 100%
                of the home's value (sometimes up to 106% including closing costs).</li>
            <li><strong>Interest rates:</strong> Fixed for 10–20 years is standard; variable rates are rare.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>NHG (National Mortgage Guarantee)</h3>
        <ul class="custom-bullets">
            <li><strong>What it is:</strong> A government-backed guarantee that lowers mortgage interest rates if the
                home price is below a ceiling.</li>
            <li><strong>2025 limit:</strong> Approximately €450,000 (adjusted annually).</li>
            <li><strong>Benefit:</strong> 0.5–1% lower interest rate than non-NHG mortgages.</li>
            <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Prioritize homes under the NHG limit if possible.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Hiring a Makelaar (Buying Agent)</h3>
        <ul class="custom-bullets">
            <li><strong>What:</strong> A licensed real estate agent who represents buyers (not sellers).</li>
            <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> Access to new listings 24 hours before they appear on public sites like
                Funda.nl.</li>
            <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Usually paid by the seller; you don't pay directly.</li>
            <li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Hire an English-speaking makelaar if your Dutch is not yet fluent.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The School System (If You Have Children)</h3>
        <ul class="custom-bullets">
            <li><strong>Age 4:</strong> Children start Basisschool (primary school). Enrollment is mandatory.</li>
            <li><strong>Age 12:</strong> The "Citotoets" exam and the teacher's advice determine the secondary school
                track:
                <ul class="custom-bullets">
                    <li>VMBO (Vocational, 4 years) — trades, apprenticeships</li>
                    <li>HAVO (Professional, 5 years) — business, management</li>
                    <li>VWO (Academic, 6 years) — university preparation</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Note:</strong> The Dutch system is meritocratic but can be inflexible once assigned a track.
                Switching is possible but requires passing exams.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Year 4: The Integration Phase (Language & Culture)</h2>
        <p>By Year 4, you are moving toward long-term residency. Language, cultural knowledge, and financial planning
            become critical.</p>

        <h3>Inburgering (Integration Exams)</h3>
        <ul class="custom-bullets">
            <li><strong>What it is:</strong> A mandatory integration program for most non-EU skilled migrants and family
                members aiming for long-term residency or citizenship.</li>
            <li><strong>Exam components:</strong>
                <ul class="custom-bullets">
                    <li>Reading (Dutch A2 level)</li>
                    <li>Writing (Dutch A2 level)</li>
                    <li>Speaking (Dutch A2 level)</li>
                    <li>Listening (Dutch A2 level)</li>
                    <li>KNM (Knowledge of Dutch Society) — civics, culture, history</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Current requirement:</strong> A2 language level (basic fluency).</li>
            <li><strong>2026 outlook:</strong> Strong political pressure to raise the requirement to B1 (intermediate).
                Plan ahead and aim for B1 to be "future-proof."</li>
            <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> Typically 1 year of classes and preparation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Language Level & Practical Tips</h3>
        <ul class="custom-bullets">
            <li><strong>A2 (Baseline):</strong> Understand routine conversations, ask for directions, handle everyday
                interactions (shops, restaurants, doctor).</li>
            <li><strong>B1 (Target):</strong> Participate in meetings, understand news, write emails, discuss opinions.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Resources:</strong> Duolingo, Rosetta Stone, local language schools (gemeente often subsidizes
                integration courses).</li>
            <li><strong>Immersion:</strong> Work, socialise, and consume Dutch media (NOS news, Omroep Max podcasts,
                Dutch films).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>30% Ruling Transition</h3>
        <ul class="custom-bullets">
            <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> If you arrived in 2025, your 30% ruling will phase out (or decrease) around
                Year 4 (2028–2029).</li>
            <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Your net salary will drop significantly — typically 10–20% of gross income.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Planning:</strong>
                <ul class="custom-bullets">
                    <li>Review mortgage applications before phase-out (lenders approve based on current income).</li>
                    <li>Build savings buffer during the ruling period.</li>
                    <li>Consider salary negotiation before the ruling ends (transition cost to employer).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Year 5: The "Decision" Phase (PR or Citizenship)</h2>
        <p>At the 5-year mark, you face a major decision: stay permanently as a PR or commit to citizenship.</p>

        <h3>Permanent Residency (PR)</h3>
        <ul class="custom-bullets">
            <li><strong>What it gives you:</strong> The right to stay in the Netherlands indefinitely without needing a
                work sponsor or visa renewal.</li>
            <li><strong>Key advantage:</strong> You keep your original passport and nationality.</li>
            <li><strong>Work:</strong> You can work for any employer or start a business without restrictions.</li>
            <li><strong>Requirements:</strong>
                <ul class="custom-bullets">
                    <li>5 consecutive years of legal residence in the Netherlands</li>
                    <li>No travel absences of more than 6 months (cumulative) during the 5 years</li>
                    <li>No absence of more than 3 consecutive months if repeated 3+ times during the 5 years</li>
                    <li>Sufficient income (roughly €1,500–€2,000/month, depending on family size)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Application:</strong> Apply at your local gemeente after the 5-year period is complete.</li>
            <li><strong>Processing time:</strong> 2–4 weeks typically.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Citizenship (Naturalization)</h3>
        <ul class="custom-bullets">
            <li><strong>What it gives you:</strong> You become a Dutch citizen with a Dutch passport (if applicable to
                your country).</li>
            <li><strong>Key advantage:</strong> Full EU citizenship rights (freedom of movement, voting in local
                elections, etc.).</li>
            <li><strong>The catch:</strong> The Netherlands generally does <strong>not</strong> allow dual citizenship.
                You may have to renounce your original nationality unless:
                <ul class="custom-bullets">
                    <li>You are married to a Dutch person</li>
                    <li>Your country of origin does not permit renunciation (some countries do not allow it)</li>
                    <li>Renunciation would cause undue hardship</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Requirements:</strong>
                <ul class="custom-bullets">
                    <li>5 consecutive years of legal residence</li>
                    <li>Passed inburgering exams (language + KNM)</li>
                    <li>Good conduct (no serious criminal record)</li>
                    <li>Sufficient income</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> Application to passport — typically 2–3 months.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The 5-Year Rule & Absences</h3>
        <ul class="custom-bullets">
            <li><strong>Critical:</strong> If you leave the Netherlands for more than 6 months (cumulative) or 3+ months
                at a time (3 times in 5 years), the 5-year clock resets.</li>
            <li><strong>Tracking:</strong> Keep records of your departures and returns; the gemeente tracks this via
                immigration data.</li>
            <li><strong>Extended work assignments:</strong> If your employer sends you abroad, ensure your residence
                status is maintained (some permits allow absence with specific conditions).</li>
        </ul>

            <li><strong>30% ruling ending:</strong> Plan financially for the impact on your net income by Year 4.</li>
