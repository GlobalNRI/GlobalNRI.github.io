        <h1>Buying a Second House in the Netherlands</h1>

        <p>Practical guidance for non-residents and residents considering a second home—holiday, investment, or future
            retirement property.</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Purchasing a second home in the Netherlands is possible for both residents and non-residents. Second homes
            include holiday homes, investment/rental properties, and secondary residences. Rules, taxes and financing
            differ from buying a primary home—this page summarizes the most important points and steps to take.</p>

        <h2>Key Legal & Tax Considerations</h2>
        <ul class="custom-bullets">
            <li><strong>Transfer tax and other purchase costs:</strong> Buying a property incurs transfer tax and notary
                fees. Rates and amounts vary depending on whether the property is used as a primary residence or not;
                consult a notary for current rates and exact costs.</li>
            <li><strong>Property taxes and municipal charges:</strong> Ongoing costs include municipal property tax
                (OZB), water board charges and waste/solids fees. Some municipalities charge a tourist tax when you rent
                short-term.</li>
            <li><strong>For flats:</strong> Apartments are usually part of an owners' association (VvE). Check the VvE's
                financials, reserve fund and rules before buying.</li>
            <li><strong>Energy and inspections:</strong> Properties must have an energy label; organising an inspection
                (bouwkundige keuring) is recommended before purchase.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Financing & Mortgages</h2>
        <p>Mortgages for second homes are available but often come with stricter lending conditions: lower
            loan-to-value, higher interest rates, and additional documentation. Non-residents can obtain mortgages in
            the Netherlands, but lenders typically require more proof of income and may limit the loan amount.</p>
        <p>Speak with a mortgage adviser (<em>hypotheekadviseur</em>) early to get pre-approval and to understand tax
            implications (e.g., mortgage interest deduction rules usually apply only to primary residences).</p>

        <h2>Buying for Short-Term Rental or Investment</h2>
        <ul class="custom-bullets">
            <li><strong>Local rules:</strong> Municipalities set rules for short-term rentals (Airbnb-style). Some
                cities restrict or require permits—check the local municipality regulations.</li>
            <li><strong>Tourist tax and administration:</strong> If you rent to tourists you will likely collect tourist
                tax and must register guests in accordance with local rules.</li>
            <li><strong>Insurance & management:</strong> Insure the property for rental use, and consider a local
                property manager if you don’t live nearby.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Practical Buying Steps</h2>
        <ol class="custom-bullets">
            <li>Set a budget including taxes, notary and refurbishment costs.</li>
            <li>Research locations and local rules (tourist permits, VvE status, rental demand).</li>
            <li>Contact a local real estate agent (<em>makelaar</em>) and a mortgage adviser.</li>
            <li>Visit properties and order a technical inspection before committing.</li>
            <li>Negotiate and sign the purchase agreement; hire a notary for transfer and deed.</li>
            <li>Complete utilities, insurance and any registration (for rentals or tenants).</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Ongoing Costs & Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>Budget for regular costs: insurance, property tax, utilities, maintenance, and VvE contributions for
            apartments. If renting out, also budget for cleaning, management fees and any local taxes.</p>

        <h2>Checklist</h2>
        <ul class="custom-bullets">
            <li>Confirm transfer tax, notary and purchase costs.</li>
            <li>Review VvE documents (if applicable).</li>
            <li>Obtain a building inspection and energy label.</li>
            <li>Get mortgage pre-approval from a lender.</li>
            <li>Check local short-term rental rules and permits.</li>
            <li>Arrange appropriate insurance for second-home use.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Next Steps & Contacts</h2>
        <p>If you want, contact a local <strong>makelaar</strong>, a notary (<strong>notaris</strong>) and a mortgage
            adviser for tailored guidance. They can provide up-to-date tax rates, fees and municipal rules for the
            location you are considering.</p>
