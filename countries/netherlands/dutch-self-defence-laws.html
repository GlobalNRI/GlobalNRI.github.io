        <h1>🚨 Home Security: Essential Guide for Expats in the Netherlands</h1>
        <p class="intro">
            This guide consolidates official Dutch police advice and community insights regarding targeted burglaries. It
            provides critical, actionable steps to enhance your home security and reduce your risk.

            <h3>⚠️ Current Risk: Professional Casing and High-Value Asset Focus</h3>
            <p>
                Professional, highly mobile criminal groups are known to target specific communities, focusing on homes perceived to
                hold **significant cash and gold**. Watch out for **"casing" attempts** (e.g., strangers knocking or asking irrelevant questions)
                as a precursor to a break-in.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card danger-card">
            <h2>Why Criminals Target Specific Homes</h2>
            <p>The selection process is strategic, relying on high-probability indicators:</p>
            <ul class="custom-bullets">
                <li>
                    <strong>Perceived Asset Concentration</strong>: The belief that valuable, untraceable assets (gold jewellery and cash) are stored
                    on-site due to cultural habits.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Visibility & Identification</strong>: Overt external cultural identifiers (symbols, decorations, or specific signage) simplify
                    the process of locating the target community's homes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Digital Surveillance</strong>: Monitoring public or poorly secured community platforms (WhatsApp, Facebook) to identify
                    windows of opportunity, such as travel periods or large local events when homes will be empty.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Low-Risk Calculation</strong>: Burglars avoid confrontation. The penalties for simple property theft (0–4 years) are significantly
                    lower than crimes involving violence (4–12 years).
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="card green-card">
            <h2>🛡️ Updated Preventative Measures & Safety Checklist</h2>
            <p>A multi-layered defense using physical, digital, and neighbour strategies is most effective. Time is costly for burglars—make entry difficult.</p>
            
            <h3>1. Door and Window Security (Hardening the Structure)</h3>
            <ul class="custom-bullets">
                <li>
                    <strong>Certified Locks</strong>: Install locks, hinges, and fittings with the **SKG-Logo (Stichting Kwaliteit Gevelbouw)**, which indicates resistance time. Aim for **2 or 3 stars**.
                    
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Always Lock Up</strong>: Always turn the key at least once when leaving, even for five minutes, to prevent "shimming" (using a plastic card to force the latch). **Never leave the key on the inside of the door.**
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Windows</strong>: Close all windows, including small, tilt-and-turn (kiepstand) windows, as these are easily hooked open.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Sliding Doors (Schuifpui)</strong>: Secure these vulnerable entry points with an **anti-lift system** or a special lock bar.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Upper Floors</strong>: Secure balconies, accessible windows, and skylights, especially if reachable via a flat roof, garage, or shed.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Deterrence and Visibility (Making the Home Look Occupied)</h3>
            <ul class="custom-bullets">
                <li>
                    <strong>Smart Lighting</strong>: Use timers, smart plugs, or **dusk-to-dawn switches** in multiple rooms (not just one) to simulate varying activity patterns. Burglars prefer to work in the dark.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Remove Climb Aids</strong>: Store all ladders, crates, bins (kliko's), and tools out of sight and away from the exterior walls, as they can be used to climb to upper floors.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Keep Valuables Out of Sight</strong>: Place laptops, tablets, expensive electronics, keys, wallets, and jewellery away from clear view through windows or doors.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Privacy for Keys</strong>: Never attach an address label to your key ring. **Never hide spare keys** under mats, flowerpots, or in the meter cupboard—burglars know these spots.
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>3. Financial, Digital, and Community Security</h3>
            <ul class="custom-bullets">
                <li>
                    <strong>External Storage (Gold/Cash)</strong>: Use a **certified third-party safe-deposit locker** (kluis) for high-value items, as home insurance limits for jewellery are often low (e.g., €5,000).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Neighbourhood Watch (WABP)</strong>: Join or create a **WhatsApp Buurt Preventie (WABP)** group with trusted neighbours to share alerts about suspicious activity and keep an eye on each other's homes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Holiday Protocols</strong>: If away, ask a trusted neighbour to collect mail, open/close curtains, park their car in your driveway, and if possible, leave some used coffee cups or a newspaper visible to simulate presence. **Never announce your absence on social media.**
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Post-Incident Protocol: Critical Actions</h2>
            <p>If you suspect or discover a break-in, follow these steps to ensure safety and preserve evidence:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Safety First: DO NOT ENTER</strong>: If the intruder may still be inside, leave immediately and call 112 from a safe distance. **Do not touch anything** to preserve fingerprints and DNA evidence.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Report Immediately</strong>: Call the non-emergency police line (0900-8844) for a confirmed break-in, or **112** if there is an emergency or threat. Obtain an official **case number (proces-verbaal)** for insurance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Contact Insurance</strong>: Notify your **Home Contents Insurance (Inboedelverzekering)** provider immediately. Confirm your specific policy limit for cash and jewellery (many policies cap jewellery coverage around **€5,000–€10,000**).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Community Coordination</strong>: Work with neighbors and community members to file a **joint complaint** (gezamenlijke aangifte) for related incidents. This helps the understaffed police connect patterns and raises the investigation priority.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="card police-priority">
            <h2>Police Prioritisation & Solvability (Modus Operandi)</h2>
            <p>The Dutch police (Politie) focus limited resources on cases with the highest solvability or threat level:</p>
            <ul class="custom-bullets">
                <li>
                    <strong>Violence Trigger</strong>: Any crime involving harm or violence receives the absolute highest priority and deep investigation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Modus Operandi (MO) Match</strong>: Cases that align with a known, sophisticated criminal operating model (like the targeting of a specific community) are prioritised to dismantle the organized group.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Evidence Quality</strong>: Cases with strong forensic evidence (fingerprints, CCTV footage, DNA) have a higher chance of being pursued.
                </li>
            </ul>
