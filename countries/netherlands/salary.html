    <h1>Salary, Taxes & 30% Ruling in the Netherlands</h1>

    <p>
        Dutch salaries are quoted as gross annual amounts. Income tax and social contributions are deducted to calculate your net pay. Expats may benefit from the <span class="highlight">30% ruling</span> to reduce taxable income.
    </p>

    <h2>Income Tax Basics</h2>
    <ul class="custom-bullets">
        <li>Progressive tax system (higher income → higher tax rate)</li>
        <li>Social security contributions also deducted</li>
        <li>Typical tax + contributions: 30–40% depending on salary</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>30% Ruling</h2>
    <ul class="custom-bullets">
        <li>Applies to highly skilled expatriates hired from abroad</li>
        <li>30% of gross salary can be paid tax-free</li>
        <li>Reduces taxable income to 70% of gross salary</li>
        <li>Applies up to 5 years</li>
