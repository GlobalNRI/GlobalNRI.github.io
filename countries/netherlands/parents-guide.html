        <h1>Parenting & Childcare — Netherlands</h1>
        <p>A practical, step-by-step guide for new parents: pregnancy, birth, healthcare, childcare, schooling and costs.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="container">
        <h2 class="section-title">Before You Arrive: Pregnancy & Birth Planning</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Register with a midwife (verloskundige) early:</strong> If you are pregnant, book an appointment as soon as you arrive — prenatal care is midwife-led for low-risk pregnancies.</li>
            <li><strong>Health insurance:</strong> Dutch basic insurance covers maternity care after you become resident. If arriving pregnant, get private coverage or check with insurer about emergency coverage until BSN/insurance active.</li>
            <li><strong>Hospital vs. home birth:</strong> Many choose midwife-assisted home births; discuss options with your midwife and check hospital facilities for C-section or high-risk care.</li>
            <li><strong>Language support:</strong> Request an interpreter or English-speaking midwife if needed; many practices in major cities provide English services.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-title">At Birth — Practical Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Obtain a birth certificate (geboorteakte) from the municipality where the child is born — required for passport and BSN.</li>
            <li>Register the child with the municipality to receive a BSN for the baby (usually within days).</li>
            <li>Apply for child benefits (kinderbijslag) and parental leave payments through the Sociale Verzekeringsbank (SVB) if eligible.</li+>
        </ol>

        <h2 class="section-title">Postnatal Care & Vaccinations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Youth healthcare (Jeugdgezondheidszorg):</strong> Free check-ups and vaccinations through JGZ; enrol your child once you have a BSN.</li>
            <li><strong>Vaccination schedule:</strong> Follow the national RIVM schedule; most vaccines start at 6 weeks to 2 months depending on the program.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-title">Childcare Options & Costs</h2>
        <p>Common childcare types:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Daycare (daycare centers / kinderdagverblijf):</strong> Full-day care for infants and toddlers; average cost 2025: €7–€9 per hour depending on region.</li>
            <li><strong>Childminder (gastouder):</strong> Home-based care with childminder, usually slightly cheaper and flexible hours.</li>
            <li><strong>Preschool / Kindergarten (peuterspeelzaal / peuterspeelgroep):</strong> Early socialization programs; subsidised places available.</li>
            <li><strong>After-school care (buitenschoolse opvang, BSO):</strong> For school-aged children outside school hours.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Childcare subsidy (Kinderopvangtoeslag)</h3>
        <p>Many parents are eligible for childcare allowance depending on income and working hours. Apply via the Belastingdienst with your DigiD once registered.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Schooling — From Primary to Secondary</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Primary school (Basisschool):</strong> Starts at age 4–5; many international and bilingual schools exist in larger cities.</li>
            <li><strong>Secondary tracks:</strong> VMBO, HAVO, VWO — choose track based on academic ability; international schools follow IB/UK/US curricula.</li>
            <li><strong>School choice:</strong> Admissions for international schools can have waiting lists; apply early and keep local public schools as backup.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-title">Parental Leave & Benefits</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Maternity leave (zwangerschaps- en bevallingsverlof):</strong> Typically 16 weeks (4-6 weeks before due date + 10+ weeks after) with pay via employer or UWV depending on contract.</li>
            <li><strong>Parental leave:</strong> Shared parental leave has been expanding; check current rules with UWV and employer for pay entitlements.</li>
            <li><strong>Child benefit (kinderbijslag):</strong> Paid quarterly by SVB; apply after registration.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-title">Practical Tips & Local Resources</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Join local parent groups:</strong> Many municipalities and expat communities run parent-and-baby meetups — helpful for childcare recommendations.</li>
            <li><strong>Transport with children:</strong> Consider a cargo bike for short trips in cities; public transport is child-friendly but check stroller rules on trains/trams.</li>
            <li><strong>Medical emergencies:</strong> Use emergency number 112 for urgent cases; for non-urgent medical advice, contact your GP.</li>
            <li><strong>Costs:</strong> Expect childcare and housing to be the largest expenses; research local subsidies and tax benefits.</li>
        </ul>
