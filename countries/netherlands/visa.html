        <h2 class="section-title">Netherlands Visa — Detailed Guide</h2>

        <p>The Netherlands offers multiple residence and work routes depending on your purpose: highly skilled workers, EU Blue Card holders, regular work permits, graduates seeking an orientation year, start-ups, students, family reunification, and long-term residency. Below is a concise breakdown of the most common visa types, how to apply, typical validity, salary guidance and common document requirements. Rules, fees and salary thresholds change frequently — always verify the latest requirements with the Dutch Immigration Service (IND): <a href="https://ind.nl/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ind.nl/en</a>.</p>

                <li><strong>Minimum salary:</strong> Varies by age and year and is updated annually. Approx ranges (for guidance only): senior threshold ~€4,500–€5,500 gross/month; lower thresholds apply for younger applicants and recent graduates. Employer must meet threshold — check IND for current figures.</li>

        <h3>How to apply — common steps</h3>

            <li>Employer or sponsor applies as required (many work routes are employer-led).</li>
            <li>If required, apply for an MVV (entry visa) at the Dutch embassy/consulate in your country.</li>
            <li>Submit documents: passport, photos, employment contract/enrolment, proof of income, diplomas, insurance.</li>
            <li>Pay IND application fees and await decision; some routes require a TB test or additional checks.</li>
            <li>If approved, register with your municipality, get BSN (citizen service number), and arrange health insurance.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Processing times, fees and practical notes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Processing times:</strong> Vary by permit type and complexity; employer-sponsored residence permits and single permits are often faster than family or PR applications. Expect weeks to several months.</li>
            <li><strong>Fees:</strong> IND fees differ by permit type and nationality; consult <a href="https://ind.nl/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ind.nl</a> for current fees.</li>
            <li><strong>Salary thresholds & rules:</strong> Salary thresholds and minimums are updated yearly. Use IND as authoritative source for up-to-date figures.</li>
            <li><strong>Language & integration:</strong> Permanent residency and naturalisation routes typically require integration tests or language knowledge.</li>
