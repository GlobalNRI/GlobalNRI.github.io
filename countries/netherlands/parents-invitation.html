        <h1>Inviting Parents to the Netherlands — Documents & Checklist</h1>

        <p>This guide lists the documents commonly required when inviting parents to the Netherlands for a short family
            visit (Schengen / Long-stay depending on duration). Requirements vary by consulate; use this as a
            comprehensive checklist and confirm with the VFS/Embassy handling your area.</p>

        <h2>1. Invitation Letter (from Sponsor in NL)</h2>
        <p>The invitation letter is the primary document. It should include:</p>
        <ul class="custom-bullets">
            <li>Full name, date of birth, passport number and address of the invitee (parent).</li>
            <li>Full name, address, contact, BSN (if available), and passport/ID of the sponsor in the Netherlands.</li>
            <li>Relationship to the invitee and purpose of visit (e.g., family visit, wedding, medical).</li>
            <li>Exact travel dates, duration of stay and proposed accommodation details (address where the parent will
                stay).</li>
            <li>A clear undertaking of accommodation and financial support (if sponsor will cover costs).</li>
            <li>Signature of the sponsor and date. Include scanned copy of sponsor's passport/ID and proof of residence.

        </ul>

                in-laws).</li>

            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Financial Documents</h2>

                region.</li>
