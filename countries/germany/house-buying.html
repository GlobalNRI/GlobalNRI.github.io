    <h2>Renting vs Buying</h2>
    <p>Renting is common in larger cities; buying requires larger down payments and understanding regional markets.</p>

    <h3>Buying process</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Find a property, sign a purchase agreement, and complete notary formalities.</li>
      <li>Expect additional costs: notary, land registry and transfer taxes (~3.5–6.5% depending on state).</li>
      <li>Speak with local mortgage advisors for eligibility and interest rates.</li>
    </ul>
