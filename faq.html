                <h3>Can I apply for a job abroad without a visa?</h3>
                <p>
                    In most cases you need a valid work permit or visa to start employment.
                    Some countries offer job-seeker or search visas that allow time to find work.
                    Check the destination country's official immigration site for exact rules.

                <h3>Which countries have high demand for IT professionals?</h3>
                <p>
                    The Netherlands, Germany, Canada, Australia and parts of Scandinavia
                    regularly hire skilled IT workers. Demand depends on specific skills
                    (cloud, data, security) and language/visa requirements.

                <h3>How do I prepare my CV/resume for international applications?</h3>
                <p>
                    Tailor your CV to local conventions (short summary, clear dates, outcomes),
                    highlight remote/cross-border projects, and include links to portfolios or
                    GitHub. Consider a short cover letter explaining relocation intent.

                <h3>Can NRIs buy property in the Netherlands?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes—non-residents can buy property, but mortgage access and taxes depend on
                    residency, income, and lender policies. Speak with a `hypotheek` adviser early.

                <h3>What are the typical buying costs I should budget for?</h3>
                <p>
                    Common costs include: purchase price, transfer tax (may be reduced for buyers
                    under 36), notary fees, valuation, technical inspection (~€400–800),
                    estate agent fee (1–2%), and mortgage arrangement costs.

                <h3>How long does buying a house usually take?</h3>
                <p>
                    From offer to keys typically 6–12 weeks for straightforward transactions,
                    longer if there are financing or survey delays. See our Paperwork & Timeline page for details.

                <h3>How do I open a bank account as a non-resident?</h3>
                <p>
                    Requirements vary: ID, proof of address, BSN (if available), and sometimes an
                    appointment at a branch. Several banks offer expat onboarding—see our Banking & Tax page.

                <h3>What is NHG and why does it matter?</h3>
                <p>
                    NHG (National Mortgage Guarantee) reduces lender risk and can lower mortgage
                    rates. It has eligibility limits (see our House Buying page) and a one-time fee.

                <p>
                    In the Netherlands, residents must take out basic health insurance. New arrivals
                    should register with a GP and choose a health insurer; see our Health Insurance page.
